## About Me
:wink: My name is Richard, a first year master student of **Biochemistry and Molecular Biology**. I am studying viruses and hopefully I am going to integrate statistic tools and bioinformatic methods into my research. Honestly I don't have much experience with coding, but I am really excited to take this course and receice proper training.

I am from China and have been to **UBC** last summer for my research internship. It's nice to be back, although the endless rainy season is somewhat disappointing.:tired_face:
